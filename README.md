Our team designed, built, and progammed a ground robot for mapping a physical environment using LiDAR and SLAM. The project was divided into two parts: [project_1](https://github.com/willward20/the-bot-bros/tree/main/project_1) and [project_2](https://github.com/willward20/the-bot-bros/tree/main/project_2). For more details, see our project report pdfs.
